# rust_hashes
Collection of code for hashes
It is heavily inspired by code from here https://github.com/RustCrypto/hashes
This is working code for those who like to start with code that works.
Some of the docs were not very good and I had to do some searching to get the code to work.
Just cd into the code you want to run and type cargo run. 
I suggest going to https://github.com/RustCrypto/hashes , but this collection will save you some aggravation.
